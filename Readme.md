# What is KultApp?

KultApp is an open source tool for sharing and communicating with your friends the
right way. It puts emphasis on privacy, anonimity and being non-interuptive.

# Manifesto

- Kults are anonymous, you are not forced to use your real name, pseudonyms are
welcomed.

- Kults are closed, you can only join if you are invited by a member. This makes
getting rid of spammers easier while still allowing unlimited community growth.

- Kults are private by default, only kult members can see it's content. If you
want to you can make it available (read-only) to the public.

- KultApp is made for non-interuptive async communication, which means that you
won't get notified and interupted in your daily flow all the time.

- Kult is open source, so you can be sure that nothing sinister is done with
your data.

- In kult you are not the product, the plan is to finance Kult development by
providing a hosted service which will be paid. If you don't feel like paying
you can always host it yourself.
